Versions are available here for the Altair 8800 (16k Basic), ZX Spectrum 48k, ZX81 (16k), Sinclair QL and 
Cambridge Z88. Except for the Altair, they all use the BASIC that was supplied in the machine, and all use the same game 
engine. The Z88 and QL versions make use of the more advanced BASIC features such as parameterised procedures.

The display of each version is basically the same layout, but with differences for each computers 
graphic capabilities.
